# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Official Blockchain Haters Club

  The Official Blockchain Haters Club (O.B.H.C.) is a limited collection of 
  500 unique NFTs on the Solana network, including some of the best and most 
  critical statements and questions from haters. This collection is inspired 
  from all of the negative and hateful opinions about blockchain, crypto, NFTâ€™s, 
  and the decentralization space as a whole.

  We truly believe that blockchain technology, along with what it enables, is 
  the technology of the future. NFT's are inherently more valuable than people 
  think, and we want to prove that.
